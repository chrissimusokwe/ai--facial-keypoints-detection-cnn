# Facial Keypoint Detection
This repository contains the 'Facial Keypoint Detection' capstone project of the Udacity's [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889).

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Computer Vision capstone project in the AI Nanodegree program! In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning to build and end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints, as shown below.

## Project Components
The project will be broken up into a few main parts in one Python notebook:

Part 1: Investigating OpenCV, pre-processing, and face detection

Part 2 : Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect facial keypoints

Part 3 : Putting parts 1 and 2 together to identify facial keypoints on any image!

## Install

 1. Download the necessary Python modules:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
 2. Open the notebook:
> jupyter facial-keypoints-cnn.ipynb

I hope you enjoy it!
